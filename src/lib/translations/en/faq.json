  "how_does_livetl_work.text": "LiveTL is, at its core, just a <i><b>chat filter for YouTube streams</b></i>. <b class=\"text-red-600\">LiveTL does not automatically translate streams</b> – instead, it picks up translations found in the chat. This helps foreign viewers better catch translations that other viewers are providing in the YouTube Live Chat.",
  "livetl_not_loading.title": "I opened my stream with LiveTL but it isn’t loading?",
  "livetl_not_loading.text": "The chat may be temporarily unavailable. LiveTL will only load if the stream has a valid Live Chat or Chat Replay.",
  "no_translations.title": "I don’t see any translations in the translations panel?",
  "no_translations.text": "If there are no translators in chat, LiveTL is unable to display translations. Any messages properly tagged with a language code (ex. <code>[en] &lt;translation&gt;</code>, <code>ESP: &lt;translation&gt;</code>, etc.) will appear when they appear in chat.",
  "translator_own_tags.title": "A translator is using their own style of language tags, how do I make them show?",
  "translator_own_tags.text": "You can manually select additional users to filter in the settings."
